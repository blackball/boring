Boring
===

Here is a fast coding ground for me, when I felt that tha real life was boring, 
I would like to write some code snipts here. Those codes all would be formed in 
rush, with merely unit tests. If one piece of codes need too much time, it will 
be boring too. The only principle here is KISS:

      Keep It Simple, Small !

Mostly, I will write some old fashion structures or algorithms, but I would like 
to rush some tricky routines too. If somebody is serious with some codes here, 
welcome to contribute. 

Life is boring, I am coding for fun.
